# Consolidation Cleanup Report

**Date**: 2025-10-29T18:34:57.851Z
**Patches**: 531-533

## Summary

This cleanup removes duplicate validation pages that were created during iterative development.
All validation functionality has been consolidated into the primary module directories.

## Impact

## Next Steps

1. Update App.tsx to remove routes to deleted directories
2. Test consolidated validation pages
3. Verify no broken links in the application
